"""Build most_played.json: Steam's most-played games, focused on Proton.

Steam's GetMostPlayedGames returns the current top titles ranked by players,
each with a peak_in_game count. We keep the ones we have compatibility data for
and attach their overall tier from search-index.json, so the homepage can show
"Popular games on Steam" with each game's Proton rating.

Games with a known compatibility tier (platinum/gold/silver/bronze/borked) fill
the first section. Games that appear in Steam charts but have no rated reports
yet are collected separately with rating="pending", so the homepage can offer a
"Not rated yet" toggle pointing contributors at popular untested games.

Steam APIs are not CORS-enabled, so this runs in the pipeline (server-side) and
emits a static most_played.json that the web UI fetches.
