"""Fetch release years for Steam apps whose titles collide in search-index.json.

A small but high-value enrichment: most games have unique titles, but when two
or more (e.g. Prey 2006 vs Prey 2017) share an exact name, the storefront badge
alone is not enough for users to tell them apart. Steam's appdetails endpoint
returns release_date, which we cache and write back into search-index column 7.

Strategy:
  - Only fetch for Steam numeric app IDs (GOG/Epic ids are skipped; their
    catalogs already encode store + slug).
  - Only fetch for apps whose normalized title appears two or more times in the
    current search-index.
  - Cap fetches per run with PROBE_CAP so a cold start does not hammer Steam.
  - Cache forever -- release dates do not change.
