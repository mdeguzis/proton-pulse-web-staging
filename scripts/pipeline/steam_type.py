"""Fetch the Steam appdetails `type` field for Steam apps in search-index.

Steam apps come in several flavors: game, dlc, mod, demo, video, hardware,
software, movie, series, episode, music. The browse view needs this to
offer a Type filter chip (so a user can hide DLC/video/software while
scanning their library) and to drop truly-non-game types (movie / music /
hardware / series) that will never have Proton compat data.

Strategy mirrors release_years.py:
  - Only Steam numeric app IDs get probed (GOG / Epic ids ship a store
    prefix and are not covered by Steam's appdetails endpoint).
  - Fetches are capped per run so a cold start does not hammer Steam.
  - Cache-forever semantics: an app's type is a Valve-side classification
    that effectively never changes.

The cache stores the raw string ("game", "dlc", ...) or None when Steam
returned success=false (delisted, region-locked, or non-existent app).
Empty-string writes into search-index column 11 mean "unknown"; the
frontend defaults to treating unknown as game for filtering purposes.
