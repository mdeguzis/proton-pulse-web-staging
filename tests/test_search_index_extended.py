"""Tests for generate_extended_steam_index (#134).

The extended index is the long-tail companion to search-index.json: every
Steam catalog entry that is NOT already in the primary index, with NO
ProtonDB-known gate. The frontend lazy-loads it only when the user opens
the grouped search results page, so the cost is paid once per session
instead of on every page load.
